Recipe:
Ingredients:

    2 1/2 cups of all purpose flour (300g)
    1 tsp of baking soda (5g)
    1/2 tsp of salt (2g)
    1/2 cup of unsalted butter (113g)
    1/3 cup of brown sugar (65g)
    1/3 cup of white granulated sugar (75g)
    2 tsp of vanilla extract (10g)
    1 large egg
    1 cup of cottage cheese, blended (225g)
    1 cup of chocolate chips (170g)

Equipment:

    Bowl
    Spoon
    Whisk
    Mixer, optional
    Sheet pan or cookie sheet
    Silicone baking mat or parchment paper

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 350F/176C. Add the cottage cheese to a blender and blend until smooth and there are no large chunks of cheese.

Add the flour, salt, and baking soda to a medium bowl and whisk. You can also put those ingredients in a sifter and sift them if you like instead.

Add the softened butter, brown sugar, and white granulated sugar to a large bowl and mix with a spoon or an electric mixer. Then add the vanilla extract and egg and mix until combined.

Next, add the blended cottage cheese and mix until combined.

Add the chocolate chips and stir those in then add the flour mixture a little at a time until all combined and you are left with the cookie dough.

Use a cookie scoop or two spoons and place cookie dough on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. You should be able to get 12 of them on there. Space them about 2 inches apart.

Bake at 350F/176C for 10 to 14 minutes until lightly golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 2 to 3 minutes then transfer to a wire cookie rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
