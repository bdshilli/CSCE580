Ingredients

Batter

    1 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose (188 g)
    3/4 cup of granulated sugar (150 g)
    1/2 tsp of salt (2 g)
    2 tsp of baking powder (8 g)
    1/2 tsp of cinnamon (1g)
    1/2 tsp of nutmeg (1g)
    1/3 cup of canola oil (75g)
    1 large egg
    1/3 cup of milk (78 ml)
    1/2 tsp vanilla extract, optional (2 ml)
    1 Large apple, diced into small chunks

Crumble Topping

    1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)
    1/3 cup of all-purpose flour (42 g)
    1/4 cup of softened butter (57 g)
    1 tsp of ground cinnamon (4 g)

Tools/Equipment

    Whisk
    Large mixing bowl
    Knife
    Cutting board
    Peeler
    Muffin pan. This is my favorite muffin pan. It is ceramic nonstick and just works amazingly.

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 400°F/205C.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, oil, milk, and vanilla extract. Then add the flour mixture and mix, using a silicone or wooden spoon. It may be a little thick; if so, add 1 to 2 additional Tbsp of milk.

Rinse and dry your apple, then it is your choice whether you peel it or not. I usually peel mine. Next, chop it up into little chunks; the smaller the better. Add those chunks and fold them into the batter.

Now make the crumble or streusel topping. Add the softened butter to a medium bowl along with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Mix with a fork to make small to large clumps. Make sure there are no dry bits left

Scoop the batter evenly into a muffin pan with paper cups. If you need a good nonstick muffin pan, the one I have is amazing.

You should be able to get 12 muffins. Then sprinkle the crumble/streusel topping evenly on top.

Bake at 400F/205C for 20 to 28 minutes until golden brown on top and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the muffin. In my oven, 25 minutes is usually enough time.

Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy!
